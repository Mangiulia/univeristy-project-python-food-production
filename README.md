# Analysis of European Countries by Food Production
This project was developed by me during my time at university and was created using online resources and domain-specific books as sources of inspiration. The goal of this project was to explore and learn through practical examples, combining various information and techniques found in these resources to bring it to completion. I would like to mention that the source code of this project is posted on GitHub, but it is set to private to avoid any form of plagiarism, as it is the result of my own personal work.
# 
In this project, I chose to develop software for data analysis focused on food production in European countries, using dimensionality reduction methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA). The choice of this topic was motivated by the economic and social importance of food production, as well as the availability of relevant data on the Kaggle platform.
# Motivation for Choosing the Project
I decided to focus on food production in Europe due to the regionâ€™s high diversity and complexity in resource management. I aimed to gain a detailed understanding of the economic and social factors that influence food production in this specific area. The dataset used was translated and narrowed down to European countries to offer a more focused analysis.
# What the Project Covers
The project focuses on two main dimensionality reduction methods:

1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): This method synthesizes the initial variables into a smaller number of components that retain the majority of data variance. I included various tables and charts showing the variance of the principal components and the relationships between variables.
2. Factor Analysis (FA): Similar to PCA, factor analysis explores the internal structure of the data to identify correlations between variables. The project features tables and graphs with rotated and unrotated factors, communalities, and factor score maps.

3. # Key Elements Presented

- Variable Description: The dataset contains food production data from 40 European countries, including products like corn, wheat, rice, chicken meat, and other key food items.

- Score Maps: I utilized geospatial data to create maps that highlight the distribution of food production across Europe, providing a visual perspective on the data.

- Interpretation of Factors and Components: The project includes detailed analysis of the relationships between variables and the main factors, using statistical indices such as KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) to assess data factorability.
- Through this project, I successfully extracted essential insights into food production trends in Europe and provided a detailed analysis of the data using modern dimensionality reduction techniques.
